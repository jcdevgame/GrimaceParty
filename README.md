# GrimaceParty
This is the official repository for Grimace Party.

This game is made in C++ and sfml. The current installation is pretty annoying and tedious, that is why I am planning to make an installer for this.

How to install:
1. Download the grimace party
2. Unzip it
3. Move the folder GrimaceParty to you C:/ (c drive)
4. You can now play!!! The exe is called console application. I am too lazy to rename it sorry :(
