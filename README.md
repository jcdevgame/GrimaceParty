# GrimaceParty
This is the official repository for Grimace Party.
All of the brand new and released updates will be published here.
The current version is still in Alpha Testing.
There is also the prototype test that is available here.

I'm guessing that I will use the GrimaceParty repository currently for the official new releases, but I feel like in the future, I might add this to steam or make a website for the download.

Extra Info:
- This game is made in C++ and SFML
- Before I make any ther stuff, make sure that you move the file to C:/ (C drive), or it might not work. (I'm working on a solution right now)
- If you download the game, Thanks!
